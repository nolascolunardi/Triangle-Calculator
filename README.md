# Triangle Area Calculator ðŸ”¢

## Overview

This project demonstrates a simple Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach to calculate the area of a triangle in differents ways using Java.

### 1. **Base and Height Method**:

Calculates the area using the formula: `(b * h)/2.`
This method is straightforward and uses the base and height of the triangle.

### 2. **Cartesian Coordinates Method**:

Calculates the area using coordinates in a Cartesian plane within the positive quadrant.
